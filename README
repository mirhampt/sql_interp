sql_interp
==========

Safely and easily interpolate Python variables into SQL based upon context.  Most
of your interaction with this package will be through the ``SQLInterp`` class::

    >>> from sql_interp import SQLInterp

    >>> person = {'last_name': 'Doe'}
    >>> criteria = {'first_name': ['Jane', 'John']}

    # Create an instance of SQLInterp and use the interp method to get the SQL and bind
    # variables ready to pass to your database cursor.
    >>> sqli = SQLInterp()
    >>> sqli.interp("UPDATE people SET", person, "WHERE", criteria)
    ('UPDATE people SET last_name = ? WHERE first_name IN (?, ?)', ('Doe', 'Jane', 'John'))

Caution
========

sql_interp works by assuming that any non-string variables passed to ``interp`` need
to be treated as bind variables.  This means that any arguments passed that are strings
will be treated as raw SQL.  If you are not careful, this could lead to a SQL injection
attack.  To avoid this, if there is any chance at all that a variable is a string, you
must tell sql_interp that it is not raw SQL.  You can do this with the ``esc`` method of
the ``SQLInterp`` object.

Here is an example::

    >>> sqli = SQLInterp()
    >>> first_name = 'John'

    # The following is wrong!  This could lead to a SQL injection attack.
    >>> sqli.interp("SELECT * FROM table WHERE first_name =", first_name)
    ('SELECT * FROM table WHERE first_name = John', ())

    # This is the correct way.
    >>> sqli.interp("SELECT * FROM table WHERE first_name =", sqli.esc(first_name))
    ('SELECT * FROM table WHERE first_name = ?', ('John',))

This does not apply if the string is a value in a list or dictionary as in the other
examples in this documentation.

Examples
========

The ``SQLInterp`` object can handle interpolating many different types.

    >>> age = 25
    >>> first_names = ['Jenny', 'John', 'Jeremy']
    >>> sqli.interp("UPDATE people SET age =", age, "WHERE first_names IN", first_names)
    ('UPDATE people SET age = ? WHERE first_names IN (?, ?, ?)', (25, 'Jenny', 'John', 'Jeremy'))

Interpolation is context sensitive, so the same type will be interpreted into SQL
correctly for its usage.

    >>> punk_rockers = {'hair': 'pink', 'tattoos': 'three'}
    >>> accessories = {'piercings': 6, 'pants': 'vinyl'}
    >>> sqli.interp("UPDATE people SET", accessories, "WHERE", punk_rockers)
    ('UPDATE people SET pants = ?, piercings = ? WHERE hair = ? AND tattoos = ?', ('vinyl', 6, 'pink', 'three'))
